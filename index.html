				<p class="col-12 text-center">Top 5 New Technology Trends starting from 2021
Technology today is evolving at such a fast pace, enabling faster progress and accelarating the rate of change until it will become exponential. 
The outbreak of COVID-19 is making only top technologies to evolve and IT professionals to realize that their role will not stay the same in the near future.
They constanlty need to search, learn and experience new technologies out of necessity if not desire.
Let me remind you that some of the most iconic tech innovations of 2010s are ipad and 4G networks, now we wear computers on our hands predicting our health statuses.
Smartphone manufacturers, social media, e-commerce, streaming media, car companies, fin tech are still investing millions to keep advancing their products but there are some sectors that are really are making or preparing massive changes in our lives.

								<h4 class="tm-gallery-title">IoD</h4>
								<p class="tm-gallery-description ">
								Drones are rapidly growing in popularity. 
								Greek startups are coming out with new drone softwares and services backed up from big , also Greek, technological orgainizations.
								They are still in the infancy stage in terms of mass adoption and usage, but drones have already broken through rigid traditional 
								barriers in industries which otherwise seemed impenetrable by similar technological innovations.
								Over the past few years, unmanned aircrafts have become central to the functions of various businesses 
								and governmental organizations and have managed to pierce through areas where certain industries were 
								either stagnant or lagging behind. From quick deliveries at rush hour to scanning an unreachable military base, 
								drone features are proving to be extremely beneficial in places where man cannot reach or is unable to perform 
								in a timely and efficient manner.
								Whether is for Unmanned cargo transport, Law enforcement and border control surveillance or for hundreds of more 
								uses, drones are underway due to the multiple investments pouring into this promising industry everyday.

								<h4 class="tm-gallery-title">IoT and Digital Twins</h4>
								<p class="tm-gallery-description">
								IoT industry is emerging the last decade and digital twins are rising fast.
								According to Deloitte study, the global market for digital twins is expected to grow 
								with 38% CAGR to reach $16 billion by 2023.
								A digital twin is a virtual/ digital replica of physical entities such as devices, 
								people, processes, or systems that help businesses make model-driven decisions. 
								Digital twins are changing the way work is done in different industries with varying 
								business applications. Knowing those applications can help businesses implement digital 
								twins into their processes. Therefore we examined digital twin applications in manufacturing, 
								healthcare, supply chain and retail. 
								A crisp example of this technology is with Healthcare providers and pharma companies 
								who can use digital twins to model the genome code, physiological characteristics, 
								and lifestyle of patients so that healthcare companies can provide personalized care 
								such as unique drugs for each patient.

								<h4 class="tm-gallery-title">5G</h4>
								<p class="tm-gallery-description">
								Another technology trend that are tightly coupled with the IoT and IoD is 5G. Where 3G and 4G technologies 
								have enabled us to browse the internet, use data driven services, increased bandwidths 
								for streaming on Spotify or YouTube and so much more, 5G services are expected to revolutionize our lives.
								by enabling services that rely on advanced technologies like AR and VR, alongside 
								cloud based gaming services like Google Stadia, NVidia GeForce Now and much more. 
								It is expected to be used in factories, HD cameras that help improve safety and 
								traffic management, smart grid control and smart retail too.

								<h4 class="tm-gallery-title">Blockchain</h4>
								<p class="tm-gallery-description">
								Although most people think of blockchain technology in relation to 
								cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, blockchain offers security that is 
								useful in many other ways. In the simplest of terms, blockchain can be 
								described as data you can only add to, not take away from or change. 
								Not being able to change the previous blocks is what makes it so secure. 
								In addition, blockchains are consensus-driven, so no one entity 
								can take control of the data. With blockchain, you don’t need a 
								trusted third-party to oversee or validate transactions.
								IBM in 2018 utilized blockchain to modernise global supply chains.

								<h4 class="tm-gallery-title">Cybersecurity mesh</h4>
								<p class="tm-gallery-description">
								There is no technological advance without the need for a cybersecurity-focused solution.
								COVID-19 has forced many companies to adopt 
								a digital approach with many assets hosted on the cloud and the ability 
								to be accessed anywhere. This means the focus of the ‘cybersecurity mesh’ 
								is providing flexibility across all assets whilst setting up the suitable 
								parameters without bogging down on operations. 
								With more operations and admin, it slows organizations’ growth, 
								so companies are looking to reduce this complexity.
								The cybersecurity mesh is a distributed architectural approach to scalable, flexible, 
								and reliable security control. </p>

		<h4 class="tm-gallery-title">Final note</h4>
					<p class="tm-gallery-description">
					After the big changes of COVID-19 we have seen how companies transformed
					and adapted in the new environment leveraging technology in various ways.
					Although there are many other trends, 
					I wanted to cover off a few that were, in my opinion and in my scope, 
					some of the more interesting to watch for the next years.
